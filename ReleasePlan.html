    <h1>
        Release Plan
    </h1>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        Savior's release plan has been changed to a two part release. Here's what that means...
    </p>

    <div style = "display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center; gap:16px;">
        <img src = "../assets/SaviorPart1Logo.gif">
    </div>
    <br>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        Part 1 of Savior has everything you've seen up to this point. It will be focused on the main mechanics, such as the combat, spells, areas,
        enemies, etc. It will also feature Farming as a full feature. While it's benefits will be limited mainly to Material gain until Part 2, it is
        still a good few hours of grinding to get the farm as efficient as possible given some of the upgrades you can get with the farm. As a whole,
        farming is the last feature needed to be completed for this release before bug fixes and polish. You can unlock farming by taking out the last 
        boss, at which point the game will prompt you that an evil has been dispelled and you can return to a certain somewhere to start farming.
    </p>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        The release date for Part 1 is scheduled for May 22nd, 2026. While this date could change, splitting the game into parts essentially
        prevents that. 
    </p>

    <div style = "display:flex; flex-direction:column; align-items:center; gap:16px;">
        <img src = "../assets/SaviorPart2Logo.gif">
    </div>
    <br>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        Where the first part is focused on the mechanics, Part 2, being later in the game, is focused on story. There will not be any major new 
        mechanics, currently, that will be implemented in Part 2, with most of it being reworking aspects of development to drive the story. There
        is no planned release date for Part 2, but it won't necessarily be released all at once, with potential betas or expiremental toggles to 
        allow players to continue if they want to.
    </p>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        If I had to guess, Part 2 would likely be released mid-late 2027.
    </p>

    <h3 style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        How frequent will development updates be after Part 1's release?
    </h3>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        Likely following my quaterly-ish update schedule, with a major development update every season, but I think it might become more frequent.
    </p>

    <h3 style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        Do you have to buy both parts separately?
    </h3>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        No. The game will be listed simply as Savior, and it will be updated to include other parts to the game. You only have to pay for it once.
        While $9.99 is a bit high for Part 1, when you add Part 2 to it, I think it will be worth it. The price will not increase after Part 2 releases
        just because it came out, there would have to be other factors, but there is no planned price increase.
    </p>

    <h3 style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        How frequent will Part 1 development updates be?
    </h3>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        Following roughly the same schedule. I have a development update planned for around a month or so from now.
    </p>

    <h3 style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        When will the previously teased epilogue be released?
    </h3>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        I'm hoping to keep it at a Part 1 and 2, but if the Epilogue increases in scope then I will have it as a larger update. 
        I doubt that would happen though.
    </p>

    <h3 style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        Will there still be updates after Part 2?
    </h3>

    <p style = "text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
        I might have a few, but I think I'd rather save everything for a potential sequel. Depends on how complete the feel the full game will be.
