            Hello everyone, I have returned with some major news for Savior. This is quite possibly the largest announcement I've had for the game in 
            quite some time outside of areas and trailers.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            To start, the release date of Savior. I am currently working towards a release date of...
        </p>

        <h1 style = "background-color: beige;">
            May 22nd, 2026
        </h1>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            That also just so happens to be my birthday. Savior's development is actually going smoothly, and I expect that the game will have all of 
            it's major content finished by the end of the year, leaving time for polish, bug fixes, and maybe even work on some updates down the line.
            My goal is to have everything finished and in a state ready to be released at least a month in advance.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Now, as for the Steam page, that should be launched late next month, around the last weekend of August. In September, there will be a super
            polished build of the game as a free demo. It will only be the first few areas, but the art will be updated to look a little nicer, and it 
            will just feel like a better product overall. This demo is actually key to ensuring a full release in May of 2026.
        </p>

            As well, the website is also up and running, but you're reading this, so you knew... I think. If not, click <a href = "https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=8GUGhJaeSeU_Bmg0">here</a>.

            The Nintendo Switch 2 just came out with some interesting controllers. Joy Con 1 and 2 work fine, although if there is time, I will try to 
            implement support for the new mouse mode since that can work really well in Savior's favour. The new Pro Controller also works just fine. I 
            wasn't worried about the new tech, since it's very similar to the predecessor.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            At the time of writing, which is July 2nd, 2025, I have finished the concept for the first major bossfight that isn't optional. The other bosses 
            are major, yes, but they aren't as special as this one. It's not optional and you have to face it. Once that's done, the mountains are essentially 
            over.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            As for the feature ballot from a while back, I was hoping to have something a little sooner, but it was quite a large feature that won. In the 
            second round, the options were between a Bow, Farming, and Bombs. Well, Farming won with 81.6% of the vote. It's taking longer to implement than 
            I thought, so it will be released as a free update later on instead. It was overwhelming to see the amount of suggestions, but hopefully farming 
            will be suffice. The idea of a bow might also get revisited in the future, but for now, it will be left on the cutting room floor.

            This is the full world of Savior. As you can see, it's quite a diverse landscape. After the mountains, we still have the badlands, swamp, and city 
            to get through before even making it to the wooded isle, which can be considered two regions. So when you think about it, the game has 4.5 areas left.
            We're almost at the end of this dungeon crawler's development.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            That's it for me today. I am very excited to see the end of the multi-year project and can't wait for everyone to get their hands on it. The 
            game will be priced fairly inexpensively, at $14.99 CAD. It's a good thing to pick up if you can't play Grand Theft Auto 6 right away. Thank you 
            for your continued support on Savior's development.
