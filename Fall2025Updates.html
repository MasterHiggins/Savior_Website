        <p class = "article-margins">
            Hello everyone. Thank you for reading this fall update on Savior. This is the first update since the split of Savior between part one 
            and part two, ignoring any dev articles or anything else of the like. Unlike the <a href = "Summer2025Updates.html">summer update</a>,
            this update is much smaller, with very little to share.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            First, I'd like to cover the progress for Part 1... it's now in bug fixing. Yes! Finally! It has been nearly 2 years since Savior began
            development, and now we're approaching the release of a playable, commercial version.  
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Next up is the steam page. The steam page is finally up. You can now wishlist the game. I will not have the option for preorders, I feel it
            would be unfair to have preorders for half of a game, and for a digital release. Instead, I have a special offer.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            If you buy the game in the first 7 days of it's release, it will be 10% off. The game is already inexpensive at $9.99 CAD, but as a thank 
            you to early buyers, I'll give a small discount.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Now, I don't want to cover specifics from the new trailer, so instead I'll give details of farming maybe not shown in the trailer.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Farming is a great way to gain materials. After finishing the mountains, you'll be able to go back to the island to farm. Because of the great 
            ending fooling up local ecosystems, you're growing literal material. 
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            These crops will take roughly 10 minutes to grow at first. However, you can offer materials to a statue on the farm to speed this process up.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            There's also a few more statues. Interact with these to get certain boosts. You can move faster, you can deal more damage, lose the spell 
            cooldown, lower spell costs, etc. Of course, you can also use these materials to upgrade your main weapon as well.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            The full list of Savior farming trades, go <a href = "releases/Farming.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Farming is intended to get many upgrades in the second part. Originally, there weren't going to be any trades, but it didn't feel like it would
            be worth it if that were the case, so I went this route instead. You can get all your levels up first.
        </p>

            Part 1 Minor Updates Announced
            </b>
        </p1>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            As said at the end of the video, Savior is intended to have minor updates after release between Parts 1 and 2. Basically, if there is a small 
            easter egg, then it would probably be dropped in a minor update for the main game alongside the <b>expirament</b> toggle play some Part 2 stuff
            early. The first minor update is planned and may end up in the main game, but no promises.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "article-margins">
            But otherwise, it will be minor things, like a new room in each region with a special character, or a small story, or a settlement, etc.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            That's it for this update. Thank you for reading, and I hope that the game isn't getting boring. It feels as though these updates aren't 
            as fun as they used to be, but I've been building a lot of mechanics without any real way to do them fast because of bugs. Regardless, this
            is a game I still enjoy playing, and I've been the one suffering through development for so long, so I'm sure everyone will love it. Maybe.
