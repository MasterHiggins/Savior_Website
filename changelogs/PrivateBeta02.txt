For Developers:
This build of the game allows access to the console by pressing the 9 key. For commands, go to devpages. Some inaccesible commands:
-Connect/___/___
--devpages/aws, string.
--This allowed to connect to devpages or an aws platform to send data to other users with developer permissions. This has since become defunct and inaccessible.
-DirectModify/___/___/___/___
--area, grid/enemy, index start, index end.
--This command allowed for directly editing data stored in the game, however this was removed and only accessible to main developers who actually know what they're doing.
