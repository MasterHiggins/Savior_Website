           Hello everyone!
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            With Savior Part 1 releasing very soon, I wanted to take the opporunity to celebrate with *GASP* PROMOTIONS!
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            First, a promo for everybody. The game will be $7.99 CAD at launch, from May 22nd, 2026 to May 29th, 2026. Sfter that, the price will be 
            the planned $9.99 CAD.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            As well, for those who pick up the game in the first two months, there are some in game benefits for doing so. On this website, a page where you 
            can load your save file will appear. By loading this save file, you will gain 50 materials. If you load it after you complete Part 1, you will 
            gain 200, and your weapon will increase one level. This will only be for a limited time and is irreversible. The game was not designed around this, 
            but if you're having some early troubles, then this is a very nice help.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            If however, you don't want the stuff, you can also access an exclusive article on some behind the scenes stuff. You will get some cool insights on
            parts of the game that have spoilers, which is why it's locked behind completing Part 1 to access it.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Lastly, there is a giveaway for 5 free copies of Savior planned, but the details aren't ironed out yet.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Hopefully this will make the launch a bit more exciting than the game actually just releasing. Thank you all for your support!
        </p>
