            In Savior, you can find many different environments, cultures, and layers to the world, and one way that I wanted try to encapsulate
            that was to add an empire, which wouldn't really have lore until after the game is completed. I decided it would be best to first
            introduce the main fortress, and the general idea behind the empire, then have a bit of a more standard area, get through all the
            visible areas on the map (such as the lake), and then introduce some of the other elements, such as the actual main hub of the empire.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            The main idea of the Nuggetarian Empire is that it's existed for thousands of years, but it hasn't always spanned just the forest. It
            has a mysterious history, and putting it in the woods gives a feeling of depth, as you don't know what could be contained within a dense
            set of trees. I think this will definitely be helpful in implementing secrets (This article was written before the release of the public
            beta). I particularly like the character for the king, King Nugget. He seems nice, but talking to the locals provides an insight to his 
            borderline dictatorship he's used to rule over the empire.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Outside of the story, this is the first region so far that contains more open elements. For example, the lake is a larger area split
            into 4. In the future, this approach will be taken. The more you explore, the greater the rewards. You may even find new weapons. I'm 
            a little disapointed with how the second area turned out. It was incredibly linear with larger areas. This region, I want to have
            incredibly large places split among areas, such as the lake.
