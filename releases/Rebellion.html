        <p class = "article-margins">
            I'm taking a small break from main development this week (I know, upsetting), but instead, I will be sharing a little insight into, 
            a group found in the <a href = "empire.html">Nuggetarian Empire</a> that is a little less than happy to say the least.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            The group has actually been around for ages, but the monarchy has never been able to determine the identities of its members. They
            started shortly after the empire's loss in the great Sterzonian Western War, which forced the migration of the empire into the forest.
            Rumor has it that the second king was so bad that people created a group just to make jokes and ridicule him about his big nose. Now,
            you can no longer be king if you have a nose bigger than 2 and a half inches, which is still kinda long, but not 5 inches long like 
            the second king's was. 
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            You may have noticed some messages around that look like scrambled messages, however, the group actually uses a code to encrypt what
            they're actually saying so officials won't go after them too hard. The code has been around for eons, but I'm willing to break the 
            secrecy. Use this decryption key when figuring out what the message mean: <br>
            <br>
            Original Letter = Scrambled Letter <br>
            A = U <br>
            B = V <br>
            C = W <br>
            D = X <br>
            E = Y <br>
            F = Z <br>
            G = A <br>
            H = B <br>
            I = C <br>
            <br>
            Woah that is un-centered, but this article is basically just a joke so I do not care enough to fix the CSS.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            I assume you can probably figure out the rest from there. There will not be a lot of these messages, and they might just be one off jokes,
            but now you know how to solve them if you come across it. Have fun with it!
