           Fist of all, this article will be much more technically in-depth than other articles. Please be wary of this.

            I wanted to make it known why the game has been delayed. While the original plans of late 2024 were looking good
            until about July, it was then when I decided to change how the levels and areas are designed. Not the design 
            principle, but rather the engine in how it worked.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            While the main game loop ran entirely with Python, the editor was done with JavaScript because of some open sourced
            programs and projects out there. However, I decided it would be a good idea to rework a lot of this in the event that 
            I would hire another developer to help out. As such, it was necessary to overhaul the development tools, so I could
            find anyone of any experience.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            This process took much longer than I had anticipated, so barely any progress was made on the fourth area, and instead, 
            I developed spells, which was much quicker to add than some other feature. The level editor itself wasn't changed, however, 
            it is now possible to import files used when creating something used in Scratch (A low-level learning tool), like a sprite. 
            This is so that they wouldn't just help with level development, but actual implementation of enemies, bosses, and everything 
            inbetween.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Ultimately, I am not seeking for applications, I'm more so going through potential candidates myself, but now it is much 
            easier to find a fit for developing this project. The development progress has now picked up, and it's looking like a 
            Summer 2025 launch is likely.
