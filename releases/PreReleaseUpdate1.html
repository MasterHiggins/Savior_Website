           The results of Pre release 1 have wrapped up. This was the most enoyable part of development so far, as it is mostly YouTube Shorts and 
           playing the full game (Part 1, at least).
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           This article serves more as a report on the observations I made, so it may be technical.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            There were <b>3</b> major issues this pre-release. 2 of them have been fixed for the next pre-release, starting this week. 
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            The first issue was regarding the saving of Savior. When leaving the game to go to the menu, the game would save a file, but not at that moment, 
            and instead during the 45 second session save that occurs, resulting in the game not saving if it hasn't been 45 seconds. This has been fixed.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            The second issue was regarding loading a save file. When loading, the game would not load the file correctly, and it would be a mix of the save file 
            and the loacl 45 second saves that generated from farming. This has been resolved for the next pre-release test.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            The third issue is the loading of areas altered in game by in game options. For example, if you interact with an ancient module, and a rock 
            is removed, then it may not be removed when loading. This is being worked on.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            The game, otherwise, operated as I expected, and the next prerelease test should begin late this week, early next week.
        </p>
