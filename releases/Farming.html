            Farming is a great way to gain materials. After finishing the mountains, you'll be able to go back to the island to farm. Because of the great 
            ending fooling up local ecosystems, you're growing literal material. 
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            These crops will take roughly 10 minutes to grow at first. However, you can offer materials to a statue on the farm to speed this process up.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            There's also a few more statues. Interact with these to get certain boosts. You can move faster, you can deal more damage, lose the spell 
            cooldown, lower spell costs, etc. Of course, you can also use these materials to upgrade your main weapon as well.
        </p>
        
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Farming is intended to get many upgrades in the second part. Originally, there weren't going to be any trades, but it didn't feel like it would
            be worth it if that were the case, so I went this route instead. You can get all your levels up first.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            To harvest your materials, you need to offer a statue of harvesting 250 materials. This decreases 10 times everytime you harvest until it 
            hits 0. The farm size is 400 tiles, and each crop produces 0-2 materials. That's 0-800 Materials for 250, but free after 25 harvests. Crops
            will only grow when you are present. It's a 25% chance of 0 materials, then a 75% chance of 1 material and a 25% chance of 2. So a 25% chance 
            of a dud, or 75% chance of materials.

                Below is a list of farming trades available. Please note these can change.

            <div class = "centered-object">Double all eligible stats, regardless of limits, after getting everything (20,000 Materials)</div>
            <div class = "centered-object">Gamble for a 50/50 chance of getting materials (10 Materials)</div>
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            For gambling, here is additional stats, which can only happen after getting the 50%:
            <div class = "centered-object">35% chance of getting 10 Materials</div>
            <div class = "centered-object">25% chance of getting 50 Materials</div>
            <div class = "centered-object">20% chance of getting 100 Materials</div>
            <div class = "centered-object">10% chance of getting 175 Materials</div>
            <div class = "centered-object">9% chance of getting 200 Materials</div>
            <div class = "centered-object">1% chance of getting 500 Materials</div>
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            For that last 1% chance, the game then rolls for a 50% chance. If it gets that instead, you will get 1000 Materials. Unless... 
            The game rolls it again. That 1% chance, then 50%, and then another roll. If you get a 1% chance, you'll get 5,000 Materials. Now, 
            this is incredible unlikely, a 1 in 40,000, or 0.0025% chance, but it could happen. Your odds of gaining are actually considerably
            high considering that it's pretty likely you could get a 500 Material payout early. 
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            I also want to touch on the doubling of all stats. For this, you need max growth speed reduced, your speed increased, 5 extra health from
            farming, max spell cost reduction, the sun shard, max material gain from enemies, the new spell, wasted materials, auto harvest, max 
            material capacity and max enemy miss chance. That's a lot to get, but then your stats can finally be doubled.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            All statues also has a refund sister statue. If you interact with that statue, then you'll get the invested materials back, except for
            gambling, which does not have a refund statue. Instead, there is a statue that adds the chance of getting 5 Materials, changing the roll 
            to 25% chance of nothing, 25% chance of 5 materials, and the rest as normal. This statues can activate it's perk for 100 Materials.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            When your stats are doubled, you actually can't refund this statue. Instead, you can refund the affected doubled stats individually, and then
            their restrictions are doubled. For example, the maximum material capacity can be refunded, and then you can buy it up to 400% instead fo 200%.
            When refunded, it will give you the necessary amount to purchase back up to the doubled amount, not what you paid into it.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Farming is more in depth than it is more so farming. It's solid, but it's not farming like Stardew Valley for example. It's more like 
            a tycoon, which I much prefer. It adds more background gameplay, or something to have on the side while watching a video.
