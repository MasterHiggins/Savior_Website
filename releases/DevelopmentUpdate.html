            This article acts as a technical update as to why it has taken so long.

        <p class = "article-margins">
            For the last two months, I've been slowly progressing with the dungeon portion of the game, however it has produced a number of bugs. For
            starters, the enemy rendering could use some work, and enemy loading in general. The total enemies in the game has over doubled from the 
            forest to the dungeon, going from about 240 to nearly 520. With the dungeons having so many moving parts and entities to handle, it makes
            sense why, at times, the game struggles to keep up. Luckily, there is a new process that works with the dungeon that handles enemy loading,
            however outside of the dungeon, it's causing issues in the plains area.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            The plains area is the first area in the game, and it's the area that has been worked on the most. The plains area has been the testing
            ground for the game's mechanics, and it's the area that has been the most polished. However, with the new process that works with the dungeon,
            it's causing issues in the plains area. The issue is that the new process is causing the game to load in enemies that are not supposed to be
            there. This is a problem because the game is not supposed to load in enemies that are not in the player's line of sight, it's causing the 
            game to slow down, and it's causing the game to crash. It's unplayable in these previously polished areas.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Luckily, the dungeons are almost finished, meaning that no additional entities will flood the area, causing slow downs. A lot of the errors
            have been caused by optimazations from the dungeons carrying into previous areas.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            I apologize for the lack of releases, and the incredibly lengthy development time.
