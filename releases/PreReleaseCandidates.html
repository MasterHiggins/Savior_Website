           Savior, after 7,198 blocks, 996 areas, 49 signs, 58 NPCs, 560 enemies, 1,326 assets, is now in the pre-release stage.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           As of this morning (January 16th, 2026), the first release candidate build has been created and being tested. The only thing not in the build
           is music, there's a bug that prevents the tracks from playing.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            This doesn't mean much outside of the release date, which is on course for May 22nd, 2026. Once the release candidate is ready, there will be 
            changes to the site, the steam page will (finally) go live, and some promo. I expect this to happen within a month or so.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Once Part 1 is finished, I'll be taking a short break, but then I'll be right back to working on Part 2 to hopefully get it out quickly.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            (Also, I've created various shorts that may break into feeds, see if you can spot them.)
