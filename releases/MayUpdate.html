           It's been an incredible amount of time since the last update on Savior, and I'd like you all to know what's going on behind the scenes.

        <p class = "article-margins">
            First off, the winner of the feature ballot was <b>farming</b>, something can can easily be added in a day...
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Yeah, so obviously that's not being added quickly. I've decided to hold off and do that last, after the main story of the game is finished.
            As well, there are some other things I'm hoping to do for the game as well.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            As a general progress update, the mountain area is roughly 25% complete. I was working a lot on farming in the last month or so. It's almost 
            at a point where it could be in a beta, but because a fairly large number of people voted in the feature ballot, I don't want to release it in 
            any unfinished state. On a technical level, farming is one of the hardest things to add with the current set up. Nonetheless, I intend to have 
            it ready by the game's full release.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            As for how to get Savior yourself, you will soon be able to. This July, I will have the Steam page and a proper domain for this very site. Finally!
            There's a bit of a process with some of these things, and I am personally very sorry for the long wait. Savior is being developed by just myself,
            and that means that a lot of time is spent on some of these things. Because of that, I currently do not intend to release the game this year. A 
            final release date will be chosen when I am comfortable with where progress is going.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            I'm beginning to reconsider how to make Savior work, and as such, I am debating how to move forward with a potential release. This will be cleared 
            up by the time the summer presentation rolls around. I still intend to do 3 trailers a year, at least two dev presentations at that.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Thank you for your continued patience. I hope it will be worth the wait.
