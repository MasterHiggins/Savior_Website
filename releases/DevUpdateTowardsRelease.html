           Hi everyone.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           I have a huge update today.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Today, Savior entered the Release Candidate stage. This means I have found no new issues, and the game is now considered finished. For Part
            one at least.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Wow, that was liberating.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Here's essentially what the release candidate stage means:
                <br> No major issues found
                <br> A private testing group
                <br> Last minute issues fixed
                <br> Promotion ramp up
                <br> Preorders open
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            By the end of the month, the 1.0.0 version will be built and ready for release.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           Ultimately, I know that issues will be found post release, so from May 23rd, 2026 until the same time in June, I will take a break from Part 2 for weekly bug fix updates.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            As for the timeline, Part 2 will begin loose development in the coming weeks, and full development next month.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            The game is almost here for release.
        </p>
