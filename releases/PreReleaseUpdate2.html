           The results of Pre release 2 have wrapped up. This has now become the most annoying part of development so far, as it my YouTube Shorts 
           have wrapped up.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           This article serves more as a report on the observations I made, so it may be technical.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            There were <b>2</b> major issues this pre-release. Both of them are preventing the build for Pre Release 3. 
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Both of the major issues are related to loading area changes.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            As for other issues, there are a lot this time around. They're minor, however, there is the exception of Farming. The file doesn't save your 
            progress. This is a small fix that is already patched by the time this goes out. Otherwise, farming will be a personalized experience, and as such, 
            it will be hard to release it without bugs. Please be patient with farming, as it may take until after the game releases for farming to be fully
            bug proof.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            As for minor bugs, I have a list of <b>17</b> issues that will be fixed before Pre Release 3. This should include UI issues, of which there are many.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Ultimately, this build failed in many ways, but it succeeded in more than I was expecting. I hope that it will mainly be a short parameter fix for these 
            loading issues, which would lock me into entire minor issues, which are simple and quick. Honestly, I can see Pre Release build 6 being the first Release 
            Candidate.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            My plan is to run through PR3 from start to finish, gather any last issues, then run through PR4 the same way. If that's bug free, I'll go through using
            a controller to test that out, and use PR5 for bug fixes on that. If PR5 goes well, then that will be the release candidate.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Industry wide, the Release Candidates and Pre Releases are basically the same thing to some people. To me, the release candidates will be sent out to 
            testers. If they don't report any issues, then the game is finished and ready for release.
