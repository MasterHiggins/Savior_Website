           Earlier today, I released a developer playthrough of the dungeons and spells of Savior.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
           Also announced was the Savior Feature Ballot, an opportunity to add your own ideas to the game. for two weeks starting tomorrow,
           you can submit any idea you want to be in consideration for the game. In two weeks after the first round, a second round will
           take place for another two weeks. This will feature the 3 best ideas or most popular ideas from the first round. The one which recieves
           the most votes wins, but if there isn't a majority, then I will consider adding the top 2 ideas.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
           There will be a form posted here and on a lot of social medias, like a lot, which you can submit your feature ballots on.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            As for the developer playthrough, if you want to watch it, you can watch it <a href = "../2025Overview1.html">here</a>.
