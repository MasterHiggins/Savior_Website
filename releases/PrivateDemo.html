           After a weeklong countdown, it has been revealed that it brought you too... this page. How anticlimactic.

            At the bottom of this article, there is a link to a video containing... 
            <ul>A new trailer</ul>
            <ul>Targetted release month in 2025</ul>
            <ul>Dungeon details</ul>
            <ul>Spell details</ul>

            I want to also point out that you'll probably see others produce these articles from time to time now as a result from a 
            new hiring process, which includes another programmer.
