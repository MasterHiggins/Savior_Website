           Hello everyone!
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            With Savior Part 1 releasing very soon, the next steps are crucial.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            First of all, linked below, you will find a button to STEAM, the storefront for Savior. Wishlist it (sad music) please.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Now that Part One is <b>considered to be ready for release</b>, there is one final presentation on Part 1, which is premiering February 27th, 
            2026. There is <b>only recapped</b> information for <b><i>PART 1</i></b>, absolutely nothing at all for <b><i>Part 2</i></b>.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            There is a launch discount planned, so stay tuned for an announcement on that.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Part 2 is making steady progress, and the first development update for that will be soon.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Thank you all for your support!
        </p>
