        <p class = "article-margins">
           Recently, it was announced I began work on a new game, <u>Cube Survive: The Other Sides Deluxe</u>.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Given the slow updates I've been giving on Savior, I thought the best idea would be to provide an update on both the game and how 
            Cube Survive impacted Savior's Development. 
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            The fun part about Cube Survive being a deluxe version is that I can simply reuse all of the assets from the original. I decided to make
            this deluxe version taking full advantage of skills I aquired during Savior's early development, and keeping new features low to prioritize
             quality would serve best on the part of developing both projects.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            To have minimal impact on Savior's development, I gave myself 6 weekends to make a completed product, so I decided to ahead with this 
            deluxe remaster rather than a new project entirely. I expanded the screensize, added a timer, included the level editor, and most notably, 
            spent 4 of the 6 weekends on online multiplayer.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Due to these time constraints, <b>Savior's development was never impacted</b>.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            However, because the game is getting ready for release, I have taken a short, 2 week break from Savior to ensure a smooth release for 
            the new Cube Survive project.
