        <p class = "article-margins">
            In Savior, you'll find many forms of enemies around the world, living among the locals. The people of local areas often have a task force
            to ensure enemies do not enter their settlements, but in infested regions, such as the Nuggetarian Empire, enemies can be found almost
            everywhere. These ones tend to be weaker though.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            On a technical level, the enemies are not bound to the tile grid, and can be place on a set, exact pixel, rather than something on the 32
            pixel tile system. They are also rendered completely different, with some animations on a separate timer rather than game clock. You can 
            tell which one is which, such as the skulls. If you pause the game with the skull on screen, they will continue their animations.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            When designing the Skull, the first enemy in the game, I decided to make it follow a set path rather than chase the player. It's actually
            the only enemy that currently does this, however the next enemy I'm currently on is a mix of both, which is a nice change of pace. The skulls
            are basic. One health, drop minimal materials, they are a perfect tutorial enemy. The Bull, the next enemy, is stronger, but drops a little
            more resources compared to the Skull.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Despite the really good technical work for the enemies, there are many issues. They ignore collision entirely, although this is probably fine
            if areas are designed around this. They can sometimes render over things they shouldn't. Overall though, there will be many enemies by the 
            time the game releases, as enemies are incredibly easy to add.
