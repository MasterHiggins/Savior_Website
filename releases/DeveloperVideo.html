           Today, I am dropping the all new developer video.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            It will be roughly 20-25 minutes long going over details on... 
            <ul>The code and development tools</ul>
            <ul>A small tour of the third region</ul>
            <ul>An all new feature</ul>
            <ul>A new announcement</ul>
            And a few more details spread without. 
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            As well, details on a beta build for mac will also be announced during the video.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            I've been taking a short break, but I'm back and putting the finishing touches on the fourth region at this time, then it's on to
            an onslaught of bug fixing.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            <b>Why a countdown? This wasn't worth it!</b>
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Woah there buddy, simmer down. I agree though, the countdown wasn't necessary. However, it was mostly meant as a test. I wanted to
            make sure that it would function properly for the <b>(DEVELOPER VIDEO SPOILER)</b> when that's wrapped up, for suspense and stuff.
