           Tomorrow, there will be the release of a new Savior overview video.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            In it, there will be details of the game's dungeons, spells, the fifth area, map, and more.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            There will also be details on the website, steam page release, as well as a beta build for mac.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            If you would like to see the video as soon as it releases, the countdown is now live. Once the countdown ends, you'll be taken to a page with
            the video, ready to play.

            Lastly, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you for sticking with the game so far. I hope that I can release a product that is fun to play
            and intriguing to theorize over. If you played the beta, you'll know there is some hidden lore surrounding the Nuggetarian Kingdom that I hope 
            can be fleshed out and enjoyed when the game releases later this year.
