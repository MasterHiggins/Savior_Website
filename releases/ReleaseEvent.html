           As announced already, Savior will be getting a public beta release this Friday, with a Steam storepage and website domain registered 
           within the next two weeks. However, not a whole lot was mentioned outside of that, so here is a proper outline of what's to come.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Today is Monday, and nothing will really be happening Tuesday either. On Wednesday, there will be a short overview video, going in
            depth on mechanics, regions, and anything necessary to know. There will also be a trailer or two in this video.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            On Thursday, there will be a developer presentation on how the game is being put together. There will not be any new features shown off
            during the presentation. It will be meant solely as a way to see how the game is being developed.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            And then lastly, on Friday the beta will be available to download in the beta tab that has been plaguing this site for months.
        </p>
