           Today, I am pleased to announce the developer overview video being premiered on YouTube on June 24th, 2024 at 7:00 PM EST.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            It will be roughly 10-15 minutes, and include details on... 
            <ul>A new trailer</ul>
            <ul>Targetted release month</ul>
            <ul>Combat details</ul>
            <ul>Control details</ul>
            And a few more details on top of this. 
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            As well, details on a beta build will also be announced during the video.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            There is also a planned developer presentation to provide insight on the development of the game, however that will not provide 
            any new details and is far out in the future.
