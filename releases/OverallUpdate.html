           Hello everyone.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            No huge update trailer today, but because I usually do an update during the Spring, I wanted to give one now to manage expectations beforehand.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            At this point, development on Part 1 has essentially concluded. I consider this part finished, and Part 2 has begun loosely. Some friend have 
            begun testing the full game, and a majority of game breaking bugs are fixed. We are on Release candidate 4.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            If there is ever an issue you come across when playing the game on May 22nd, 2026, shoot me a <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-higg/">message</a>
            and I will, hopefully, fix your save file and fix the bug. However, if it's small, I have also created a save file editor so you can edit it
            yourself, or you can just fool around with it. See it <a href = "../SaveEditor.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Also, I have made this <a href = "../ARG/countdown.html">countdown</a> until the game comes out, which is linked in the button below, as is everything else worthwhile from above.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Anyway, as for the updates for Part 2, I want them to be great, grand, all that fun stuff. Larger presentations, better trailers, etc. Because 
            of this, the the regular updates I do will likely be a much different schedule. I'll still try to give a progress update every season, but trailers 
            will be much more random.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Lastly, the steam page is in progress. Currently doing all the forms and whatnot, but it should be up soon with preorders immediately when 
            I can. Hopefully soon.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            I likely won't have another update until the Steam page is up.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            <b>Thank you.</b>
