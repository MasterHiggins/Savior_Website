           Recently, it was announced I began work on a new game, <u>Cube Survive 2</u>.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Wait... didn't I do <a href = "CubeSurviveImpact.html">this</a> already?
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            So believe it or not, yes. Last year, I released a project called Cube Survive: The Other Sides Deluxe. It was my yearly release that I tend
            to do annually. Would you have guessed? Well, last year I release a completed title, but this time, I had to take a creative liberty. Cube Survive 
            2 has actually not been touched in 4 months, and is releasing as is, oh well look at that, today.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Because of this, Savior hasn't been affected at all. Cool.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            Check out the game I suppose, it looks cool. It's buggy and unfinished, but it's fun to play around with it.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            However, because the game is getting ready for release, I have taken a short, 2 week break from Savior to ensure a smooth release for 
            the new Cube Survive project. But, that also coincidies with my winter break anyway, so it isn't a big deal.
