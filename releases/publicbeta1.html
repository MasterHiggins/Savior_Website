            A brand new Public Beta release has now been made available to download from this site. Please note that you must be using Windows
            10 or later in order to play this beta. It might work with previous versions, but it is not recommended. This beta is only available
            for Windows at this time, but the full game will release on Steam, which supports all platforms.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            If you had access to the closed beta released in March, a link to the changelog will be provided at the bottom of this article to see 
            what differences were made, as well as if there are any known issues.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            A link will also be attached to the article linking to the Savior Overview video, going into detail on the combat, areas, enemies, 
            etc. <b>This is currently the last intended public beta release.</b>
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Of course, there is necessary credit to give out. Credit to Garbomuffin/Turbowarp for the packager. Though inaccessible, Scratch assets
            were also used for development tools (The variable reporters and command line use Scratch scripts). As well, the beta testers before-hand,
            each of them wrote reviews, deserve the shout out for their time and feedback.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            The game is not yet complete, the website this is current on isn't even finished yet, but I am confident that by the end of June, you will be
            able to both visit this website on a domain as well as wishlist the game on Steam. I still hope to have the project finished by the end of 2024,
            but it looks more and more unlikely with each passing week. It may be pushed to Spring 2025.
        </p>
        <p class = "article-margins">
            Please note that, at this time, you can not progress any farther than the first boss. The rock that moves after the defeat of the beast does not 
            get moved away. This beta may be updated in the future to expand to the second area.
