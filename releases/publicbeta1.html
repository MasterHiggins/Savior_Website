            A brand new Public Beta release has now been made available to download from this site. Please note that you must be using Windows
            10 or later in order to play this beta. It might work with previous versions, but it is not recommended. This beta is only available
            for Windows at this time, but the full game will release on Steam, which supports all platforms.
