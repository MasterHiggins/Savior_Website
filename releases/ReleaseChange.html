           Back in July, you may remember an <a href = "../Summer2025Updates.html">article</a> I wrote where I discussed how Savior was going to
           go. Well, today, I have some updates. It's both good and bad, depending on how you look at it.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           <b>I have decided to release Savior in multiple updates.</b>
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           So, starting with release dates. The first update is releasing in November. This will be the first instance to the paid game. It will be about
           the first full 3 areas, so up to spells. Then updates will be released when they are finished. They might be regular, they might not.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game is taking an incredibly long time to release, so while I still anticipate that the full game will be finished by May 22nd, 2026, I 
            would rather give paying players the ability to play some of the game still.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of this change, the Steam Page will be going up in October, and what I anticipate to be a late October. When my first release is ready.
        </p>

        <p>
            The price will also be different to reflect this. The game will now launch at $9.99 CAD, but I may increase the price later. Currently though, my
            current plan is to keep it at $9.99. There is no need to be greedy.
