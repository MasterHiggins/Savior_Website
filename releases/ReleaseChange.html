        <p class = "article-margins">
           Back in July, you may remember an <a href = "../Summer2025Updates.html">article</a> I wrote where I discussed how Savior was going to
           go. Well, today, I have some updates. It's both good and bad, depending on how you look at it.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           <b>I have decided to release Savior in two parts.</b>
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           So, starting with release dates. The first part is releasing still on May 22nd, 2026. It's soon to be done actually. The reason why I can't 
           have them release together is because the second part is going to take a bit longer than anticipated because of real world circumstances.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           The second part will be releasing... at some point. I don't know when that will be, but if I had to guess, 2026 is not on the table.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            As for the price, this is simple. It will be on Steam as just <u>Savior</u>, no part one or two. The price will be lower than I expected, 
            I intend to release it for $9.99 CAD. Games releasing unfinished is already bad for the industry, but higher prices are even worse. The second 
            part will be free, you just have to buy it once.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
            <b>I am personally very sorry that I can not release the game in a completed state on time.</b> No one wants this game out more than me. But, 
            the silver lining is, I do have one trick up my sleeve. Farming will not be a post game update. Instead, it will be in the first part. That way, 
            you can prepare for Part 2 by passing the time farming to collect materials.
