           I survived the outing. Not only that, but I got an up close look at the minions.

           I have successfully condesned the fog into liquid. Then, solid. As it turns out, this is not subject to temperature, but rather air density?
           Within a jar tightly packed with just itself, it condensed from a dark red hue to a solid black liquid. Then, within moments, every drop formed into
           either one large worm, or thousands of tiny ones. I'll keep an eye on them for now to see what will happen.

           What confuses me is why it hasn't left the island yet? It should be big enough to cross oceans, and it can definitely see city lights or other
           small islands. Unless it's preparing to leave? I'm not sure what to think yet. So many questions.

           My personal theory is that it cannot touch water. Because of the height of the mountain erupted from the ground during the initial start of 
           the apocalypse, I assume it goes above the clouds. The fog is incredibly dense, so it sinks in the air, yet it still reached incredible 
           heights. It hasn't rained. It's been 17 days. It has not rained. It isn't rain. The rain is gone. I think it is stopping the rain. Unfortunately, 
           I did not have the opportunity to test this theory, as the fog converted within moments.

           I think what I'm going to do is try to find water. My faucets don't work, but I do have bottles. Hopefully there is still a lake nearby. Here's 
           the problem. It's nearly 5 kilometers away. I can drive, but that's loud. I can walk, but that's vulnerable. I AM NOT ENCOUNTERING ME AGAIN.

           I managed to collect more fog without leaving the house. I cut a small hole, about 15 centimeters in diameter, in my roof. It's high enough I can't
           get me, and it lets fog into my homemade collector I used with an old hot water tank. Double win, the water tank had water. When these contact water, 
           it just, disappears. Like, it doesn't even enter the water. It just disappears. I closed off the hole after leaving it going for six hours. The 20 liters 
           of water left isn't discoloured, isn't smelly, it's normal. I even drank a little, completely fine.

           I will give an update soon.
