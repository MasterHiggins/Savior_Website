           Hello Survivors.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           My name is Dr. Tyler Patrick, a historian with a PHD on mythology. Well, that "mythology" has become reality in my home town.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           Currently, out of our population of roughly 10 million on the island, 8 million have gone missing, and 1.5 are confirmed dead. President Evan
           is doing really well securing everyone from the disaster that is the sudden appearance of whatever the hell this is.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           This is where me and President Evan differ. He has hosted public speeches, because we now know that this grand entity does not understand the 
           complexities of human language. However, I am not a part of that "we" anymore.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           Yesterday, President Evan said that they were going to chemically destroy the thick cloud before it goes global. This morning, our biggest secret 
           center for scientific advances was destroyed by an onslaught of these creatures I am dubbing Minions. They have sharp features, looking like a 
           curvy starfish with a single shade of red.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           It is my belief that these missing people are somehow contributing to the growth of this entity's intelligence. However, I have reason to believe 
           the beast cannot understand written text.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           In mythology, this is clearly the great ending, which is an ancient evil that is supposedly going to consume the world. In this, the world never 
           survived, and it was a base for it to take over much more than our planet. I don't even know if it's stoppable.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           However, I do have a plan. Tomorrow, I am going to leave my basement's basement to collect a sample of this fog. Ultimately, it's fog. We can 
           condense it into water and I can study it further, something the president was unable to do in time. As far as I can tell, he isn't even on the 
           island anymore.
        </p>

        <p class = "article-margins">
           Tomorrow, there should be <a href = "Day2.html">progress</a>.
