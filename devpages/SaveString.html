    <h1>Save String Contents</h1>
    <h3>Please only directly modify the save string when absolutely necessary.</h3>

    <p>Example String: "1,lava:0:0,5,216,1369,180,5,1,0,0,false,"</p>

    <p>
        <ul>The first value is the weapon level.<ul>
        <ul>The second value is Area ID.</ul>
        <ul>The third value is the Player's Health.</ul>
        <ul>The fourth value is the Player's X Position.</ul>
        <ul>The fifth value is the Player's Y Position.</ul>
        <ul>The sixth value is the Player's Direction.</ul>
        <ul>The seventh value is the Player's Maximum Health.</ul>
        <ul>The eight value is the Current Quest.</ul>
        <ul>The ninth value is the Player's Material Count.</ul>
        <ul>The tenth value is the Map Change.</ul>
        <ul>The eleventh value is the Spells Unlocked Boolean Value.</ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The reason why there is a comma at the end is because the game reads that as the last value in the string and stops checking from there.
